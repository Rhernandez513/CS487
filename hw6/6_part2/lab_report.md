## Task 1: Deriving the Private Key

Let p,q and e be three prime numbers.  Let n = p*q.  We will use (e, n) as the public key.

Given:

p = F7E75FDC469067FFDC4E847C51F452DF
q = E85CED54AF57E53E092113E62F436F4F
e = 0D88C3

Calculate the private key d.


First n was calculated to be "n=E103ABD94892E3E74AFD724BF28E78366D9676BCCC70118BD0AA1968DBB143D1"


Note: Using Wolfram Alpha, the Decimal value of p was found to be 329520679814142392965336341297134588639
Note: Using Wolfram Alpha, the Decimal value of q was found to be 308863399973593539130925275387286220623
Note: The decimal value of e was small enouch to fit in a programmer's calculator and was found to be 886979
